# MVVMBaseGenerator
Generates ActionCommand and ViewModelBase for newest project in project directory CS

Hello folks,

I was bored of copy paste this two .cs. So I made a little project which includes both into newest project. 
All you have to do is move .exe to your project directory and execute it once after a new project was created.
